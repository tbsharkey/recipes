        <p>Enjoy your Spam Wellington with your favorite sides, such as roasted vegetables or a green salad.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 can (12 oz) of Spam</li>
            <li>1 sheet of puff pastry, thawed</li>
            <li>8 oz of cremini or button mushrooms, finely chopped</li>
            <li>1 small onion, finely chopped</li>
            <li>2 cloves of garlic, minced</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons of unsalted butter</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon of vegetable oil</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon of fresh thyme leaves, chopped (or 1 teaspoon of dried thyme)</li>
            <li>Salt and pepper, to taste</li>
            <li>1 large egg, beaten</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons of Dijon mustard (optional)</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Instructions:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat your oven to 400°F (200°C).</li>
            <li>In a large skillet, melt the butter and add the vegetable oil over medium heat. Add the onions and garlic, and cook until softened, about 3-4 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add the chopped mushrooms and thyme to the skillet. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the mushrooms release their moisture and the mixture is relatively dry, about 10-12 minutes. Season with salt and pepper, to taste. Remove the skillet from the heat and let the mushroom mixture cool.</li>
            <li>While the mushroom mixture cools, remove the Spam from the can and pat dry with a paper towel. If desired, spread a thin layer of Dijon mustard over the Spam.</li>
            <li>On a lightly floured surface, roll out the puff pastry into a rectangle large enough to enclose the Spam. Trim any excess pastry.</li>
            <li>Spread the cooled mushroom mixture evenly on the puff pastry, leaving a small border around the edges.</li>
            <li>Place the Spam in the center of the mushroom-covered pastry. Brush the edges of the pastry with the beaten egg.</li>
            <li>Carefully fold the pastry around the Spam, pressing the edges to seal. You may need to trim any excess pastry to ensure a good seal.</li>
            <li>Transfer the wrapped Spam, seam-side down, to a parchment-lined baking sheet. Brush the top and sides of the pastry with the remaining beaten egg.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 25-30 minutes, or until the pastry is golden brown and crisp.</li>
            <li>Remove the Spam Wellington from the oven and let it rest for 5 minutes before slicing and serving.</li>
        </ol>
